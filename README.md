# üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---

## üìÑ Project Description
This project focuses on performing exploratory data summarization for the Academics Department's Attendance Procedure. The aim is to extract structured academic datasets stored in the S3 bucket which are already cleaned and profiled using DataBrew and then load them into AWS Glue Crawlers to create a Data Catalog. From there, AWS Glue ETL jobs are used to generate summarized datasets for reporting and performance insights.

## üè∑Ô∏è Project Title
Exploratory Data Analysis using Summarization on Attendance Datasets for Academic Department

---

## üöÄ Objective
- Retrieve cleaned data from tranformed S3 bucket.
- Use AWS Glue crawler to catalog data.
- Summarize the data using AWS Glue ETL jobs.
- Store results in S3 Curated Bucket and catalog in AWS Glue Data Catalog.

---
## üìä Dataset
The Attendance datasets consist of below tables
- Attendance List
- Student List
- Instructor List
- Program List
- Course List

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

Below figure shows that overall architecture of the Data Analysis Platform using AWS for Academics Office.

### 1. Data Cataloging
We assume that raw Datasets in S3 bucket (Academics-raw) are already profiled, cleaned and stored in transformed buckets (Academics-trf). Those datasets will be registered into the Glue Data Catalog using AWS Glue Crawler. Create academics-crw and do data catalog. 
![image](https://github.com/Gracewinlett/data-analysis-gwl/blob/62b912a5482b826de8d898fe99ac40625049a5d1/images/1.2.png)


After running the crawler then catalog tables will be shown under Data Catalog.

Verified the cataloged data in AWS Glue and checked tables‚Äô schemas.
### 2. Data Summarization
Glue ETL jobs are then used to transform and summarize the attendance data. Summarized output is stored in the curated S3 bucket, partitioned by report date, and can be used for descriptive and visual analysis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

Below figure is the overall architecture of the Data Analysis Platform using AWS for this descriptive analysis.

![image](https://github.com/Gracewinlett/data-analysis-gwl/blob/bdfd246e94bb2d4bf8d09dc8f0606973641f5d8a/images/2.1.png)


### 1. Data Ingestion
Downloaded dataset from City of Vancouver Open Data Portal filtered for business type = "Caterer".

Uploaded the raw dataset (CSV) into the Amazon S3 raw bucket at:
/businesseconomy/business-license/year=2025/quarter=01/month=02/day=24/server=BGVS-Twl.
![image](https://github.com/Gracewinlett/data-analysis-gwl/blob/7cd1456c72e35120c85129260c7ce86bc550815f/images/2.2.png)

Another S3 bucket created to store data for data transformation. 
![image](https://github.com/Gracewinlett/data-analysis-gwl/blob/7cd1456c72e35120c85129260c7ce86bc550815f/images/2.3.png)

### 2. Data Profiling
Used AWS Glue DataBrew to create a profile job for raw dataset to assess data completeness and identify anomalies. Using that, upload dataset to transform S3 bucket and then create a data profiling job as shown in figure.
![image](https://github.com/Gracewinlett/data-analysis-gwl/blob/7cd1456c72e35120c85129260c7ce86bc550815f/images/2.4.png)

### 3. Data Cleaning
Data Cleaning is needed to make sure the dataset is structured, accurate, and usable for analysis. Created a cleaning recipe in AWS Glue DataBrew.

Tasks included:
- Remove white spaces from BusinessName, LicenceNumber, BusinessTradeName, Status,	BusinessType, BusinessSubType,	Unit,	UnitType,	Street,	City,	Province,	Country,	PostalCode, LocalArea.
- Replace text British Columbia with BC in Province
- Fill missing values with "1111-11-11" in IssuedDate and ExpiredDate
- Fill missing values with most frequent value in FeePaid
- Fill missing values with "Hidden" in LocalArea

# üìä Data Quality Control 

---

## üìÑ Project Description
This project focuses on applying data quality checks to the business license dataset from the City of Vancouver using AWS Glue ETL. The objective is to ensure the data is clean, complete, and trustworthy before further analysis.

---

## üè∑Ô∏è Project Title
Data Quality Control for Business License Dataset for Business Type "Caterers" ‚Äì City of Vancouver

---

## üöÄ Objective
To validate, clean, and assess the quality of the business license dataset by applying completeness, uniqueness, and freshness checks using AWS Glue ETL jobs and store the results into separate "Passed" and "Failed" folders for further action.

---
## üß† Background
Raw datasets often include inconsistent, missing, or outdated values, which can impact the accuracy of downstream analytics. To address this, the Data Analysis Platform includes a dedicated data quality control phase to validate key quality dimensions and support reprocessing or clean storage.

---
## üìå Scope
- Validate data completeness for key fields such as FOLDERYEAR and LicenceRSN.
- Check the uniqueness of the primary key LicenceRSN.
- Ensure issued license dates are within the last 365 days for data freshness.
- Store passed and failed records into designated S3 folders for review and processing.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

Below is the architecture diagram including monitoring using AWS components.

### 1. Build ETL Job for Data Quality Checks
An ETL job named bue-bul-QC-Twl was implemented using AWS Glue as below.

- Load Data: Load data from the S3 bucket.
- Custom Transform: Apply data quality rules.
  - Completeness: Ensure FOLDERYEAR and LicenceRSN > 0
  - Uniqueness: Ensure LicenceRSN is unique
  - Freshness: Ensure IssuedDate is less than 365 days from the current date
- Route rows: Use a conditional router to separate Passed and Failed data.
- Transform & Load: Store results into separate folders.

### 2. Store Quality Results
Passed and Failed results in csv format are saved into corresponding folders in the S3 transformed bucket.

![image](https://github.com/Gracewinlett/data-analysis-gwl/blob/68c7577c86a5413f10bd9ed136c663caf6a2863d/images/4.3.png)
